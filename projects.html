                            This was a game created in Java during my Object-Oriented Programming course with Dr. Sawin.
                            It consisted of two threaded players (user controlled, and AI controlled) moving throughout the board.
                            The catch was that the board was entirely hidden until the player had visited a certain spot on the board.
                            This made it very difficult to locate the acutal position of the Angry Jarvis. Finally, the Angry Jarvis
                            would lay homework traps around the board (close to where he was located at the time of creating one), and
                            if the player were to land on one of these spots, they would be stuck and unable to move for a short time.

                            Another project was an automatic solver for any sudoku solver. I randomly did this one night because my Dad was solving one,
                            and I was convinced that I could write an algorithm to solve the puzzle before he managed to do it by hand (even with probably
                            a couple hour head start). It's be no means an advanced algorithm as it is simply a brute force algorithm that will try every
                            possible until the end is reached.

                        This project took place during my internship with Nicolet National Bank. Which is a community bank out of Green Bay, WI. This was
                        the first project assigned to me, and the goal was to create a user interface with the Salesforce Lightning Component Framework
                        for bankers to select people associated with a newly created bank account. Taking the users selected from the user interface and
                        sending their information in a payload to an external company to automatically populate their information in a new check order.
